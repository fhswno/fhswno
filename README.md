# What will you find here? ü§î

I add common patterns and templates on this GitHub account, in order to work more efficiently when I need to implement common data structures or UI patterns on my project. I also love to write quick documentation, so that I can refresh my knowledge of a given language if needed, and start building features/projects with it. 

I can't include all of my project's code on GitHub, but if you want to see some projects or docs, feel free to let me know!

# I'm currently learning...üë∂

I'm currently learning to develop Augmented Reality experiences, with the aim of making it commercially available for cooler stuff than Snapchat Lenses or Apple Measure.

# I'm interested in...üëÄ

Building a product whose people will be able to conveniently interact with, no matter the device they use. It must have be used on mobile, web, desktop, tv, cars and even on VR headsets. The codebase must be easy to maintain, yet take care of platform specs. JavaScript end-to-end to get it done, tweeting on my progress every day.
