# What will you find here? ü§î

I'm creating repos with common patterns and templates to speed up development when building common features or UIs.

I can't include all of my projects' code on public repos, as building in public is not always a choice, but please reach out if you want to see some of my projects/docs. 

# GitHub Stats üìà

Note: These are stats on my personal repos. Contributions on organisations' repos are not included in these stats.

# I'm currently learning...üë∂

I'm currently learning to develop "greenfield" Augmented Reality experiences, with the aim to create a cross-platfrom, JS/TS-based AR framework, so developers can leverage AR for cooler stuff than Snapchat Lenses or Apple Measure. 

# I'm interested in...üëÄ

Helping non-technical people acquiring tech skills - the world needs more devs than ever, but universities, MOOCs and bootcamps create more barriers than bridges for people to dive into tech. I'm trying to build a product to address this challenge, and help anyone get in the tech industry, without student loans, without having to give up full-time employment, without having to struggle learning alone. 

Building frameworks - I think it's really easy to complain about an existing framework, but much harder to actually improve things by contributing to Open-Source projects, and actually building a better DevEx. In 2013, React changed web development forever, and websites used by billions don't have a single ```index.html``` file; in 2015, React Native introduced cross-platfrom mobile app development, and the largest social media apps are built without a single line of Swift, Objective-C, Java or Kotlin used at all. I am trying to build my own platform with one guiding principle: ```Learn once, write once, run everywhere```. The goal is to create a framework which would allow people to build for mobile, web and desktop in one codebase; with type-safety, unit tests coming out of the box, and made compulsory; without giving up on performance and security.
